## Why

Why not?  

## Future Enhancements

* QMX with feet.  In version 0.1, it is assumed that the rubber feet have not been installed on the QMX.  Since many people do install the feet, it would be nice to have an alternate design to accommodate the feet.
* Shrink it.  In version 0.1, the appendage is  bigger than the QMX itself (it is closer to the QMX+ in size).  This is due to the large battery pack.  Smaller battery packs can last through a SOTA activation.  Using a smaller battery pack could really shrink the design.
* Movable plugs.  In version 0.1, the plugs are rigidly fixed in position.  An arrangement that allows the plugs to move side-to-side and up-and-down would relieve stress on the QMX jacks.
* Add charging port.  There is easily room in the box for a BMS. And the BMS will need an additional jack for charging.
* Change the power button.  It's too easy to accidentally engage the power button in a backpack.  Either a button cover is needed or a different switch
* Fix the threading.  The threading for the plugs and jacks is not perfect so there is some wabble.  In some cases a little hot glue may be needed.  These should be fixed.
* Make the left side open-able.  Soldering in that narrow cavity is very awkward.
* Loosen the lid.  The lid currently fits very tightly.  This is both a feature (makes the retaining screw unnecessary) and a bug (it's pretty hard to slide).
* Wiring improvements and suggested wiring plan.

# qmx_appendage

## Why

Why not?  

## Future Enhancements

* Shrink it.  In version 0.1, the appendage is  bigger than the QMX itself.  This is due to the large battery pack.  Smaller battery packs can last through a SOTA activation.
* Fix the threading.  The threading for the plugs and jacks is not perfect so there is some wabble.  In some cases a little hot glue may be needed.  These should be fixed.
* Make the left side open-able.  Soldering in that narrow cavity is very awkward.
* Wiring improvements.
